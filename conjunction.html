  <h1>Conjunctions Lesson</h1>
  <div id="content">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Conjunctions are words used to connect words, phrases, or clauses in a sentence. They help to create logical relationships between different parts of a sentence and provide smooth transitions. Understanding different types of conjunctions and their usage is essential for constructing clear and cohesive sentences.</p>
  
    <h2>Error Recognition</h2>
    <p>One common error with conjunctions is using the wrong conjunction to express a specific relationship or misusing conjunctions in compound sentences. Let's look at an example:</p>
    <code>
      <p>Wrong: I want to go to the beach, but it's raining.</p>
      <p>Correct: I want to go to the beach, although it's raining.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>Conjunctions can be categorized into different types based on their functions and the relationships they convey. Here are some key conjunction types:</p>
  
    <h3>Coordinating Conjunctions</h3>
    <p>Coordinating conjunctions connect words, phrases, or independent clauses of equal importance.</p>
    <code>
      <p>Correct: I like both coffee and tea.</p>
      <p>Wrong: I like both coffee, tea.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h3>Subordinating Conjunctions</h3>
    <p>Subordinating conjunctions introduce subordinate clauses, which depend on the main clause and cannot stand alone.</p>
    <code>
      <p>Correct: She will go to the store if she needs groceries.</p>
      <p>Wrong: She will go to the store, if she needs groceries.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h3>Correlative Conjunctions</h3>
    <p>Correlative conjunctions work in pairs to connect words, phrases, or clauses and show a relationship between them.</p>
    <code>
      <p>Correct: Either we go to the movies, or we stay home and watch TV.</p>
      <p>Wrong: Either we go to the movies, but we stay home and watch TV.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h3>Conjunctive Adverbs</h3>
    <p>Conjunctive adverbs connect independent clauses and show relationships such as cause and effect, contrast, or time.</p>
    <code>
      <p>Correct: He studied hard; therefore, he passed the exam.</p>
      <p>Wrong: He studied hard; because, he passed the exam.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Conjunctions play a vital role in connecting words, phrases, and clauses in a sentence. Use the appropriate conjunctions to express logical relationships and ensure smooth transitions between different parts of your writing or speech.</p>
