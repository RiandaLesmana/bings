  <h1>Verb Tenses Lesson</h1>
  <div id="content">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Verb tenses are used to indicate the time at which an action or event takes place. Correctly using verb tenses is crucial for conveying the timeline and sequence of actions in a sentence.</p>
  
    <h2>Error Recognition</h2>
    <p>One common error with verb tenses is using the wrong tense for a specific context. Let's look at an example:</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: I went to the store yesterday.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: I will go to the store yesterday.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>There are different verb tenses to express various time frames. Here are some key verb tenses:</p>
  
    <h3>Simple Present Tense</h3>
    <p>Use the simple present tense for general truths, habits, and repeated actions.</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: She plays the piano every day.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: She is playing the piano every day.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h3>Simple Past Tense</h3>
    <p>Use the simple past tense to describe completed actions or events that occurred in the past.</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: They visited Paris last summer.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: They are visiting Paris last summer.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h3>Present Continuous Tense</h3>
    <p>Use the present continuous tense to describe actions happening at the moment of speaking or ongoing actions.</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: I am studying for my exam right now.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: I study for my exam right now.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h3>Present Perfect Tense</h3>
    <p>Use the present perfect tense to describe actions that started in the past but have a connection to the present.</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: She has lived in that house for five years.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: She lived in that house for five years.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h3>Future Tense</h3>
    <p>Use the future tense to express actions or events that will happen in the future.</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: We will have a meeting tomorrow.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: We are having a meeting tomorrow.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Using the correct verb tense helps to convey the timeline and sequence of actions in a sentence. Be mindful of the context and choose the appropriate verb tense to accurately express the time frame.</p>
