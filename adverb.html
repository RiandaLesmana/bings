  <h1>Adverbs Lesson</h1>
  <div id="content">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Adverbs are words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, providing information about how, when, where, or to what extent an action or state occurs. Understanding different types of adverbs and their functions is important for effective communication and adding detail to sentences.</p>
  
    <h2>Error Recognition</h2>
    <p>One common error with adverbs is using them in the wrong position in a sentence or using the incorrect adverb form. Let's look at an example:</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: He walked quickly to the store.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: He quickly walked to the store.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>Adverbs can be categorized into different types based on their functions and characteristics. Here are some key adverb types:</p>
  
    <h3>Manner Adverbs</h3>
    <p>Manner adverbs describe how an action is performed.</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: She sings beautifully.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: She beautifully sings.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h3>Time Adverbs</h3>
    <p>Time adverbs indicate when an action occurs or the frequency of an action.</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: They will arrive tomorrow.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: They will arrive yesterday.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h3>Place Adverbs</h3>
    <p>Place adverbs describe where an action takes place.</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: The bird flew high in the sky.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: The bird flew in the sky high.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h3>Degree Adverbs</h3>
    <p>Degree adverbs indicate the extent or intensity of an action or quality.</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: He is very tall.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: He is tall very.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Adverbs provide valuable information about how, when, where, or to what extent an action or state occurs. Use adverbs correctly to add detail and precision to your sentences, and be mindful of their position in relation to the verb or adjective they modify.</p>
