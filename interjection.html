  <div id="content">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Interjections are words or phrases used to express strong emotions, surprise, or sudden reactions. They add color, emphasis, and intensity to a sentence, but they do not grammatically connect to other parts of the sentence. Understanding interjections and their usage can help convey emotions and make your language more expressive.</p>
  
    <h2>Error Recognition</h2>
    <p>Interjections are generally used independently and do not have specific error patterns. However, it's important to use interjections appropriately to ensure they convey the intended meaning and emotion. Let's look at an example:</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: Wow, I love ice cream! How about you?</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: Wow, I love ice cream, aren't you?</p>
    </code>

    </code>
  
    <h3>Joy</h3>

    </code>
  
    <h3>Pain or Frustration</h3>
    <p>Interjections can convey pain, frustration, or annoyance.</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: Ouch! That hurt!</p>
      <p class="correct">Correct: Ugh, I can't believe I made that mistake.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h3>Greeting or Farewell</h3>
