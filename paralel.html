  <h1>Parallel Structure Lesson</h1>
  <div id="content">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Parallel structure, also known as parallelism, refers to using the same grammatical form or structure in a series of words, phrases, or clauses. Maintaining parallelism enhances clarity, balance, and readability in sentences.</p>
  
    <h2>Error Recognition</h2>
    <p>One common error with parallel structure is when the elements in a series do not match in terms of form or structure. Let's look at an example:</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: I like to swim, hike, and read books.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: I like to swim, hiking, and to read books.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>Parallel structure should be maintained when listing or comparing items in a series. Here are some key guidelines:</p>
  
    <h3>Parallel Verb Forms</h3>
    <p>Use the same verb form for items in a series.</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: She enjoys hiking, swimming, and running.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: She enjoys hiking, swims, and running.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h3>Parallel Gerund Phrases</h3>
    <p>If using gerund phrases, ensure they have the same structure.</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: He likes reading books, listening to music, and playing sports.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: He likes reading books, listens to music, and playing sports.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h3>Parallel Infinitive Phrases</h3>
    <p>If using infinitive phrases, maintain parallelism.</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: The students were asked to study hard, to complete assignments, and to participate actively.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: The students were asked to study hard, complete assignments, and actively participating.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h3>Parallel Clauses</h3>
    <p>When using clauses, ensure they have parallel structure.</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: He is either going to the movies or staying at home.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: He is either going to the movies or he will stay at home.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Parallel structure improves the flow and clarity of sentences. Remember to use consistent grammatical forms when listing or comparing items in a series.</p>
