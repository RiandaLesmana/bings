    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Prepositions are words that show the relationship between a noun or pronoun and other words in a sentence. They indicate location, time, direction, manner, or other relationships. Understanding different prepositions and their usage is essential for expressing precise meanings and providing additional details in sentences.</p>
  
    <h2>Error Recognition</h2>
    <p>One common error with prepositions is using the wrong preposition or misusing prepositions in certain expressions. Let's look at an example:</p>

      <p class="wrong">Wrong: He is waiting on the bus stop.</p>
    </code>

    <p>Prepositions can indicate various relationships, and their usage depends on the specific context. Here are some key preposition types:</p>
  
    <h3>Location Prepositions</h3>

    <code>

      <p class="wrong">Wrong: The book is at the table.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h3>Time Prepositions</h3>

    </code>
  
    <h3>Direction Prepositions</h3>
    <p>Direction prepositions indicate the movement or direction of something.</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: He walked towards the park.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: He walked to the park.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h3>Manner Prepositions</h3>
    <p>Manner prepositions describe the way in which an action is performed.</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: She painted the picture with a brush.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: She painted the picture by a brush.</p>
    </code>
