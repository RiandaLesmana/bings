  <h1>Pronouns Lesson</h1>
  <div id="content">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Pronouns are words used to replace nouns, avoiding repetition and providing clarity in communication. Understanding different types of pronouns and their functions is essential for effective writing and speaking.</p>
  
    <h2>Error Recognition</h2>
    <p>One common error with pronouns is using the wrong pronoun form or mismatching the pronoun with its antecedent. Let's look at an example:</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: She likes to ride her bike to school.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: He likes to ride her bike to school.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>Pronouns can be categorized into different types based on their functions and roles. Here are some key pronoun types:</p>
  
    <h3>Personal Pronouns</h3>
    <p>Personal pronouns refer to specific people or things and can be used as subjects or objects in a sentence.</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: She is my friend. I like her a lot.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: She is my friend. Me like her a lot.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h3>Reflexive Pronouns</h3>
    <p>Reflexive pronouns are used when the subject and the object in a sentence refer to the same person or thing.</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: I saw myself in the mirror.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: I saw me in the mirror.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h3>Relative Pronouns</h3>
    <p>Relative pronouns are used to introduce relative clauses that provide additional information about a noun.</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: The book that you lent me was fantastic.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: The book which you lent me was fantastic.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h3>Possessive Pronouns</h3>
    <p>Possessive pronouns indicate ownership or possession.</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: This is your book; that one is mine.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: This is your book; that one is my.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Pronouns play an important role in avoiding repetition and maintaining clarity in communication. Remember to use the appropriate pronoun form and ensure pronouns match their antecedents for accurate and effective language usage.</p>
