  <h1>Adjectives Lesson</h1>
  <div id="content">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Adjectives are words used to describe or modify nouns or pronouns, providing additional information about their qualities, characteristics, or attributes. Understanding different types of adjectives and their usage is essential for effective communication and vivid descriptions.</p>
  
    <h2>Error Recognition</h2>
    <p>One common error with adjectives is using them in the wrong order or using comparative or superlative forms incorrectly. Let's look at an example:</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: She is the prettiest girl in the class.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: She is the most prettier girl in the class.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>Adjectives can be categorized into different types based on their functions and characteristics. Here are some key adjective types:</p>
  
    <h3>Descriptive Adjectives</h3>
    <p>Descriptive adjectives provide details or characteristics about a noun.</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: The red car drove by.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: The car red drove by.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h3>Comparative Adjectives</h3>
    <p>Comparative adjectives are used to compare two or more things or people.</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: This book is more interesting than that one.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: This book is interesting than that one.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h3>Superlative Adjectives</h3>
    <p>Superlative adjectives are used to compare three or more things or people, indicating the highest degree.</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: She is the smartest student in the class.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: She is the smarter student in the class.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h3>Demonstrative Adjectives</h3>
    <p>Demonstrative adjectives point out or indicate specific nouns.</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: I want to buy that shirt.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: I want to buy shirt.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Adjectives are important for providing vivid descriptions and conveying specific qualities of nouns or pronouns. Remember to use the appropriate adjective forms and order, and understand the distinctions between descriptive, comparative, superlative, and demonstrative adjectives.</p>
