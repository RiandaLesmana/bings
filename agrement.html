  <h1>Subject-Verb Agreement Lesson</h1>
  <div id="content">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Subject-verb agreement is a grammatical rule that states that the subject and verb in a sentence must agree in number. This means that a singular subject should be paired with a singular verb, and a plural subject should be paired with a plural verb. Subject-verb agreement ensures clarity and grammatical correctness in sentences.</p>
  
    <h2>Error Recognition</h2>
    <p>One common error in subject-verb agreement is when the subject and verb do not agree in number. Let's look at an example:</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: The dog chases the ball.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: The dog chase the ball.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>The subject-verb agreement rule helps to maintain consistency in sentences. When the subject is singular, the verb must also be singular, and when the subject is plural, the verb must be plural as well. Let's examine some scenarios to understand this rule better:</p>
  
    <h3>Singular Subject + Singular Verb</h3>
    <p>When the subject of a sentence is singular, use a singular verb form.</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: The cat jumps over the fence.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: The cat jump over the fence.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h3>Plural Subject + Plural Verb</h3>
    <p>When the subject of a sentence is plural, use a plural verb form.</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: The cats jump over the fence.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: The cats jumps over the fence.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h3>Indefinite Pronouns</h3>
    <p>Indefinite pronouns such as "everyone," "somebody," and "nobody" are always singular and require a singular verb.</p>
    <code>
      <p class="correct">Correct: Nobody knows the answer.</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong: Nobody know the answer.</p>
    </code>
  
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Subject-verb agreement ensures that the subject and verb in a sentence are in agreement regarding their number. It helps to maintain grammatical correctness and clarity. Remember to use a singular verb with a singular subject and a plural verb with a plural subject.</p>
